stats bugs in general

philosophies:
when buying special ability, add individual features logic based on philosophy choice - TODO 2 left
add repeatableTechMultipliers to all calculating logic for various areas depending on which ones they affect - TODO 5 left
note: when the repeatabletechmultipliers are applied, they are logged in the techrepeatbles object and if they are not in the gameloop checker function like the one off space buildings is, they have to be reapplied whenever the player rebirths if they are prices or things that are reset on rebirth, ie like addPermanentCompoundsModifiersBackIn() and addPermanentResourcesModifiersBackIn() do - TODO

megaStructures:
