resource calculations are not right when burning fuel in a power station, start with carbon, pretty deep bug
tech tree not updating when research points grow to reveal more
stats bugs in general

TODO

during battle:
involve defense for enemy - have a damage mechanic depending what type of unit is attacking what type of unit with defense bonus
think about changing heat and cold resistant to somethng meaningful where you can amplify effect of defense against certain unit combinations or something like that
check for bug - undefined enemy units in battle screen if changed in passive for example in diplomacy

after battle:
make battle end when all units on one side are disabled = true and gracefully fade out units from canvas
reset flags regarding battle and set a battleWon flag to true or false
show a popup explaining to the user the result - if lost then reset state, make units prices again like they were when you had none, and replenish enemy ones but only like a quarter but no diplomacy - if won then progress on to some kind of victory dance before thinking about rebirthing
