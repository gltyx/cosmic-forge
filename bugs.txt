resource calculations are not right when burning fuel in a power station, start with carbon, pretty deep bug
tech tree not updating when research points grow to reveal more
stats bugs in general

ascendency (permanent buffs):
ideas:



helium fusion stays as ??? and causes tech tree not to work great
maybe have rows of notifications ie if fuse has loads queued up still show tech to left etc
be good to have an option to divert a resource directly to cash instead of accumulating it
